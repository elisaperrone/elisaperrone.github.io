I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science) at the Eindhoven University of Technology ([TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl)).


My research spans from mathematical statistics to applied statistics. I am mainly interested in multivariate statistics and dependence modeling, with particuar emphasis on copulas and their geometric properties. My work includes the development of copula-based approaches used in optimal experimental design and environmental sciences, such as hydrology and weather forecasting.


I hold a MSc in Mathematics from the [University of Salento](https://international.unisalento.it/departments/mathematics-and-physics) (Italy) and a PhD in Mathematics from [JKU Linz](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-applied-statistics/) (Austria). Before joining TU Eindhoven, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute for Data, Systems and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/) of [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) (Cambridge, MA), and an Assistant Professor at the  [University of Massachusetts at Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/mathematics/) (USA). In the past, I have also held research positions at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) and the [Austrian center for weather forecasting](https://www.zamg.ac.at/cms/en/news).

Here is a link to my complete [CV](PerroneCV.pdf).
