## Student Projects

I am always looking for motivated students who share my research interests.

The following is a list of research topics where I am actively offering B.Sc. and M.Sc. thesis projects. I am also happy to supervise [_internships_](https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/graduate-school/masters-programs/industrial-and-applied-mathematics0/curriculum/internship) and other research projects in Mathematics and Data Science.

* Weather forecasting (in collaboration with [KNMI](https://www.knmi.nl/home))
* Dependence modeling and copulas
* Statistics for complex data
* Applications in statistical finance
* Theory of copula models
* Design of experiments

You can have a look [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/elisa-perrone/supervised-student-theses/) for a list of project topics that I supervised in the past.

If you are enrolled at TU/e and are interested in doing a research project under my supervision, feel free to reach out!
