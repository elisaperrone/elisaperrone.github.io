My research lies at the interface between theoretical and applied statistics. I am mainly interested in _multivariate statistics_ and _dependence modeling_, with particular emphasis on _copulas_ and their mathematical properties. 
My work includes the development of novel and innovative methodology for _environmental sciences_ and _weather forecasting_.

My list of publications is available [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/elisa-perrone/publications/).


I am always looking for motivated students who share my research interests and my passion for mathematics and statistics. If you are interested in doing a research project under my supervision, you can have a look [here](teaching.html) for a list of project topics.
