My research spans from mathematical statistics to applied statistics. I am mainly interested in multivariate statistics and dependence modeling, with particuar emphasis on __copulas__ and their __geometric properties__. My work includes the development of copula-based approaches used in __optimal experimental design__ and __environmental sciences__, such as hydrology and __weather forecasting__.


I am always looking for motivated students who share my research interests and my passion for mathematics and statistics. If you are interested in doing a research project under my supervision, you can have a look [here](teaching.html) for a list of project topics.
