My research spans from mathematical statistics to applied statistics. I am mainly interested in multivariate statistics and dependence modeling, with particuar emphasis on _copulas_ and their _geometric properties_. My work includes the development of copula-based approaches used in _optimal experimental design_ and _environmental sciences_, such as hydrology and _weather forecasting_.

My list of publications is available [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/elisa-perrone/publications/).


I am always looking for motivated students who share my research interests and my passion for mathematics and statistics. If you are interested in doing a research project under my supervision, you can have a look [here](teaching.html) for a list of project topics.
